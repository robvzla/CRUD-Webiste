                    In Children Clouds we know how important that your child is very well taken care.
                    The essential function of a nanny is to be responsible for all care of the children in the home in a largely unsupervised setting. 
                    Our nannies are professionally trained and focus in child's development and well-being. 
                    This service is available only during the weekend.<br>
                    Below is a list of duties that our nanny service offers:
