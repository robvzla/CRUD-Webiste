                The concept of interactive learning through experience is the base of Abracadabra Events.
                During the interactive events, kids experience confidence, build trust, create own tools from basic elements (like paper plates and crayons). 
                Children and parents are always involved through moving, stretching, crafting, singing and becoming characters in the story.
